== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I insert a map to a page? = 
Insert the map shortcode into the text of a page or a post where you want the map to be. Short codes can be viewed on tab "Maps".

= Will I be able to visually edit settings and data? =
Yes. There is a built-in visual editor that allows you to tune up and configure map design, colors, popups and side info with zero coding. And to insert the map on a page, you simple paste the shortcode.

= I want to execute a JavaScript instead of opening a URL when the region is clicked. Is this possible? =
Yes. You can type any valid JavaScript code in the URL field of the region's settings. Note though, that the region's click option must be set to "Open a URL" in this case.
Here is an example of the JS code executing upon a click to the region:
`javascript:window.alert('Hello, World!');`

= I don't want to use popup windows. Instead, I would like to display information below the map. =
Set the region's click option to "Show more info" in the Detailed Settings section, and type the information you would like to display, or upload media.

= What kind of media can I use in the side panel displayed below the map or right of it? =
Any type WordPress can deal with.
